<h2>Welcome to the {{ policy.website_title }} Web Mail Service.</h2>
<P>
Now you need to add whatever email addresses you want to use, e.g. <b>me@{{ user.user}}</b>.
You do this by going into Settings->Accounts->Add Itentity, and adding whatever
email addresses you want to use.
<P>
You can add as many email addresses as you want in whatever domains
you own. To prove you own a domain and direct the mail
to this service, you *MUST* add an MX record in the
domain using the hostname key "{{ user.mx }}.{{ policy.email_domain }}"
<P>
To register additional domains to use in this account, you must
now go to Settings -> Accounts and click "Add an Identity"
<P>
Any domains you activate will automatically get the default email address <b>[domain-name]@{{ policy.email_domain }}</b>,
e.g. {{ user.user }}@{{ policy.email_domain }}
